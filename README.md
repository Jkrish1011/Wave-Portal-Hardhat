# Basic Social Media Platform using Ethereum build using Hardhat framework

This project is used to demonstrate the power of Web3 where the signed up users(uses metamask to add account) can send waves to the contract. This project can be considered as a best use case for beginners as it comes with a sample contract, a test for that contract, a sample script that deploys that contract, and an example of a task implementation, which simply lists the available accounts.

The link to front-end can be found here : https://waveportal-starter-project.jkitis.repl.co/

Try running some of the following tasks:

```shell
npx hardhat accounts
npx hardhat compile
npx hardhat clean
npx hardhat test
npx hardhat node
node scripts/sample-script.js
npx hardhat help
```
NOTE: This project is currently tested and deployed on Rinkeby testnet. People interacting with the application requires some fake ether in their wallets.
